I am currently a PhD candidate at [Chair of Sport and Health Management](https://www.sg.tum.de/en/mgt/home/) and [TUM School of Management](https://www.wi.tum.de/), [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/), supervised by Professor [Jörg Königstorfer](https://www.sg.tum.de/en/mgt/team/ordinarius/). Here is my [homepage@TUM](https://www.sg.tum.de/en/mgt/team/research-assistants/personal-information-yanxiang-yang/). I like running and I am an amateur tennis player.

I earned my bachelor in Management at [Shanghai University](https://www.shu.edu.cn/) in 2013 and a master in Sport Science at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2019, supervised by Professor [Sulin Cheng](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sulin-Cheng). During my Masters' degree, I spent 3 months at [German Sport University Cologne](https://www.dshs-koeln.de/) with Dr. [Moritz Schumann](https://fis.dshs-koeln.de/portal/en/persons/moritz-schumann(7217bdac-0a82-4a1d-aef5-42354c380b80).html), granted by [DAAD](https://www.daad.org.cn/zh/find-funding/funding-programmes-in-germany/master-short-term-scholarship). I also spent 6 months at [Centre for Physical Activity Research](https://aktivsundhed.dk/da/) of [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/) with Dr. [Mathias Ried-Larsen](https://aktivsundhed.dk/da/om/personer/item/mathias-ried-larsen), jointly granted by [CSC and Danish Government Scholarship](https://www.csc.edu.cn/chuguo). During my PhD, I am also fortunate to be advised by Professors [Sebastian Uhrich](https://fis.dshs-koeln.de/portal/de/persons/sebastian-uhrich(d54fc935-c4f4-4231-8196-8896b3e4c01a).html), [Tim Pawlowski](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/wirtschafts-und-sozialwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/faecher/fachbereich-sozialwissenschaften/sportwissenschaft/institut/arbeitsbereiche/sportoekonomik-sportmanagement-und-sportpublizistik/team/prof-dr-tim-pawlowski/), [Thilo Kunkel](https://sthm.temple.edu/faculty-and-staff/profile/?smid=1782), and [Daniel Funk](https://sthm.temple.edu/faculty-and-staff/profile/?smid=1771) on particular projects. 

## Research Interests
My research interests focus on sport and health management, particularly on consumer behavior. My main research line investigates the role of gamification in consumers' physical activity behavior change (fitness consumers) and engagement (sport fans). I use multiple research methodologies including quantitative (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, web scraping, meta-analysis) and qualitative (e.g., semi-structured interview) approaches. I am an R user. My research keywords are:

* Sport and Health Management
* Consumer Behavior
* Gamification
* Physical Activity
